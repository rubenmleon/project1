Hi! I’m Rubén. I’m a 23 yo aspiring DP and a total Deakins freak. I’ve been making movies since I was 12 and I just finished a Bachelor in Audiovisual Communication. I’m a very curious person and I can do a bit of everything. I can write, DP, edit, and do some VFX. I spent 2018 shooting projects for different clients around Norway with the Høgskulen i Volda and I learned some good work ethics and the importance of always having a second pair of dry socks. I’m excited to start my career and find a cool team to be part of.
